  Red Kingdom<br>
  Welcome to the Red Kingdom (yeah)<br>
  Red Kingdom<br>
  Welcome to the<br>
</p>
<p>
  Place where we run it<br>
  Place really haunted by number 58<br>
  It's DT the great and we flaunt it<br>
  Hate and we shun it<br>
  No competition, the opposition fake<br>
  I don't think they really want it<br>
  Loud is the recipe, loud sitting next to me, no doubt<br>
  Now we are proud that we get to see<br>
  KC Chiefs come and break these geeks<br>
  Make 'em taste these cleats<br>
</p>

  Welcome to the Red Kingdom (yeah)<br>

  Chiefs Kingdom, got to love us, got some other<br>
  Beasts, bring 'em, mop 'em up and stop 'em, got the<br>
  Heat stinger, you hot when we stop ya<br>
  Dropped when he rock rock, got blocked in me casa<br>
  Ball in my city live, but I find her<br>
  Raw when they get beside<br>
  My lucky numbers are 15, 10, 87, 29, 7, 50, 95, 55<br>
</p>
